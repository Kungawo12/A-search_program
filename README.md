# DelivC: A* Search Algorithm Implementation

## What You Have

### 1. **DelivC.java** ‚úÖ
Complete, working implementation of A* search algorithm
- Finds shortest path between two cities
- Uses both actual distances and heuristic estimates
- Produces formatted output showing search progression
- Handles multiple test cases

### 2. **Three Learning Guides** üìö
- **DELIVC_GUIDE.md** - Comprehensive explanation of the algorithm and code
- **ASTAR_QUICK_REF.md** - Quick reference with visualization of algorithm state
- **IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md** - Step-by-step instructions for testing and debugging

### 3. **Test Files**
- D12dist.txt - Actual distances between 12 cities
- D49dist.txt - Actual distances between 49 cities
- H12dist.txt - Heuristic estimates for 12 cities
- H49dist.txt - Heuristic estimates for 49 cities

## Quick Start

1. **Replace** your incomplete DelivC.java with the provided one
2. **Load** D12dist.txt and H12dist.txt using Prog340 GUI
3. **Click** "Run Deliv C"
4. **View** output showing the A* search steps

## How It Works (30-Second Version)

```
Start: Queue = [Start Node]
       f-value = distance + heuristic

Loop:
  - Take path with lowest f-value from queue
  - If goal reached ‚Üí STOP (you found shortest path!)
  - Otherwise expand it (add all neighbors to queue)
  - Print all remaining paths in queue
  - Repeat

Why it works: Heuristic guides search toward goal without sacrificing optimality
```

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| DelivC.java | Complete A* implementation |
| DELIVC_GUIDE.md | Detailed algorithm explanation |
| ASTAR_QUICK_REF.md | Algorithm visualization & pseudocode |
| IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md | Testing & integration instructions |

## The A* Algorithm in Context

### What Makes A* Special?
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Explores uniformly in all directions (slow)
- **Greedy Best-First**: Only follows heuristic (can miss shortest path)
- **A* Search**: Balances actual cost with heuristic (optimal & efficient) ‚ú®

### Why Two Graphs?
```
Actual Distance Graph (g):
  Minneapolis ‚Üí Chicago: 354
  Chicago ‚Üí Atlanta: 581
  (These are the REAL distances)

Heuristic Graph (gh):
  Minneapolis ‚Üí Atlanta: 400
  Chicago ‚Üí Atlanta: 300
  (These are ESTIMATES to guide search)
```

## Algorithm Flow

```
Step 1: Initialize
  - Add start node to queue
  - Print it

Step 2: Main Loop
  While queue not empty:
    - Dequeue lowest f-value path
    - If goal: PRINT and STOP
    - Mark node as processed
    - Add all neighbors to queue
    - Print all remaining paths

Step 3: Output Format
  Shortest Path from Start (Abbr) to Goal (Abbr)
  
  PATH            DIST    HEUR    F-VALUE
  Start              0      h         h
  Start-N1         d1      h1        f1
  Start-N2         d2      h2        f2
  ...
```

## Example: Boston to Dallas

**Initial State:**
```
Boston is start (value S), Dallas is goal (value G)
Queue: [Bos]
f-value = 0 + 800 = 800
```

**Expand Boston:**
```
Neighbors from actual graph:
  - NewYork: 207 away, heuristic to Dallas = 700, f = 907
  - Chicago: 859 away, heuristic to Dallas = 400, f = 1259
Queue: [Bos-NY, Bos-Chi]
```

**Expand Boston-NewYork (lower f):**
```
Neighbors:
  - Washington: 213 away, heuristic to Dallas = 600, f = 1020
Queue: [Bos-NY-Was, Bos-Chi]
```

**Continue until first path to Dallas is dequeued ‚Üí STOP**

## Why This Guarantees Shortest Path

1. **Admissible Heuristic**: h ‚â§ actual_distance (never overestimates)
2. **Always Expand Lowest f**: f = actual_cost + estimated_remaining
3. **First Arrival = Optimal**: When we reach goal, no unexplored path can be better

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Program compiles
- [ ] Loads both graph files
- [ ] Identifies start (S) and goal (G) correctly
- [ ] Produces output in correct format
- [ ] Shows all paths in queue after each expansion
- [ ] Finds goal and terminates
- [ ] Output file created with same content

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

‚ùå **Using heuristic graph for actual distances**  
‚úÖ Use actual graph for d-values, heuristic graph for h-values

‚ùå **Printing paths as you dequeue them**  
‚úÖ Print entire queue after each expansion

‚ùå **Re-expanding already processed nodes**  
‚úÖ Use closed set to prevent re-expansion

‚ùå **Continuing after reaching goal**  
‚úÖ Stop immediately when goal is first dequeued

‚ùå **Missing blank line between expansions**  
‚úÖ Print blank line before printing each new queue state

## Key Classes & Methods

### DelivC
- `performAStarSearch()` - Main algorithm
- `printQueueStatus()` - Prints all paths in queue
- `getActualDistance()` - Gets edge weight from actual graph
- `getHeuristic()` - Gets edge weight from heuristic graph
- `getNodeByVal()` - Finds start/goal by S/G marker

### Inner Class: Path
```java
ArrayList<Node> nodes;    // Cities visited
int d;                    // Actual distance
int h;                    // Heuristic estimate
int f;                    // f = d + h
```

## Learning Outcomes

After implementing DelivC, you'll understand:
- ‚úì How heuristic search works
- ‚úì Why A* is optimal with admissible heuristics
- ‚úì Priority queues and graph algorithms
- ‚úì Real-world pathfinding (GPS, games, robotics)
- ‚úì Balancing algorithm efficiency and optimality

## Debugging Tips

1. **Trace by hand first** - Do Boston‚ÜíDallas manually
2. **Print debug info** - Add intermediate output in performAStarSearch()
3. **Verify graph loading** - Print edges for start node
4. **Check heuristics** - Verify h-values against H12dist.txt
5. **Monitor queue size** - Queue should shrink as search progresses
